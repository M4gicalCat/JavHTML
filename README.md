# What is JavHTML ?

Do you like java ?
Do you like xml ?
Me neither.

That's why I've created your worst possible nightmare (I'm late for Halloween, I know).
You can now write java code in xml syntax !!!

# Who does it work ?
Write your code in the `/root` folder, and launch the `run` script.
Your code will be compiled to java in the output directory you desire, or by default `/java_output`.

# Enjoy :]
